# CC_Final_Project

## Globalization
Visualizing global interconnectedness through flight and airport data


## To Do List

1. ~~link data from routes.json to data from airports.json~~

2. ~~create classes for both routes and airports with basic shapes for each~~

3. figure out how to efficiently eliminate duplicate data

4. ~~add stage #1 motion to routes/airports shapes~~

5. ~~add stage #2 motion after mousePressed/keyPressed~~

6. ~~look into integrating giCentre library~~

7. add effects through color


## Bugs To Fix

1. ~~figure out why giCentre labels aren't displaying~~

2. remove motion from routes objects when they're moving to the center

3. ~~add motion to airports and routes objects when user releases key~~

4. optimize code to improve data loading speed
